Overview:

One big problem that I found many students in the school, including myself, have is procrastination and low productivity. It causes students to lose sleep, increase stress, and even fall into depression. Inspired by a website called Focusmate, my friend Connie and I implemented an idea where students can choose a specific time slot to work for 50 minutes while being on call with someone else to hold them accountable. During the session, microphones will be off and screens are streamed to check in on each other, making sure the other is not distracted. The calls are held on Discord, a messaging and calling application, and the schedule can be accessed through the web application created by our team. We first beta tested our idea with a small group of 6, then launched it to a server of 20 students. Everyone who used it found it very helpful and useful, as it motivated them to get into the working mindset without getting distracted. 

More on the web application:

The web application was coded by our team of four (including Victoria Li, Connie Wang, and Razi Syed) using JavaScript, HTML and CSS (using the Bootstrap library). Firebase was used as a database to store all users' information. The web application was created in the span of 48 hours and was submitted in a Hackdemonium hackathon. Our product won Best UI/UX.
